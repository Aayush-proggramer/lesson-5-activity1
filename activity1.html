                        History:
                        Cricket originated in the mid-16th century in England. The first women's cricket match was played in 1745 in Surrey,
                        England. The first international cricket match was played in 1844 between the USA and Canada.<br> <br>
                        Players:
                        Sachin Tendulkar is considered by many to be one of the greatest batsmen of all time. Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi is the
                        only cricketer to represent both India and England.<br> <br>
                        Equipment:
                        Cricket gloves are not mandatory, but they are considered an essential part of the equipment. They protect the player's
                        fingers and wrists from injury. The red ball is the first ball used in cricket, and is still used in test matches,
                        One-day Internationals, and other high-standard matches
